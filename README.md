# 🌑 Eclipse - Static Chatroom

**Eclipse** is a free, clean, and simple static chatroom built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It’s designed to be **unblocked** and **easy to use**, perfect for chatting with friends during school!

---

- `index.html` — The main chatroom page.
- `style.css` — The styling for a smooth, clean look.
- `script.js` — The frontend logic to handle chat behavior.

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Download or clone** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Start chatting with your friends!

*(Optional)* Host it on a free service like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify to make it even easier to access.

## ⚡ Quick Preview
> Eclipse is designed to feel *minimalistic yet friendly*, with soft colors, smooth animations, and a focus on the messages.

## 🔒 Notes
- This is **static only** — meaning chats are not saved once you refresh or leave the page.
- For live saving across users, you would need a server or database (but static keeps it simple and unblocked 😉).
